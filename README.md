# Bulgarian Matchbox Collection

Welcome to the first and only online catalogue of Matchbox cars made in Bulgaria 
over the years! All cars photographed here are factory made, no re-paints or customs.

Here you will find photos of all color variations I have 
or had in my collection through my entire life.

Each car have a photo and a full description about:

All photos will be hosted on the cloud (AWS S3)
